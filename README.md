<h1>Tensorflow-wrapper</h2>
A Tensorflow.js template for taking input data and building a simple neural net. This particular model learns how
to differentiate the healthiness of cereals but can be adapted to other predictive modeling scenarios.
The template will automatically sort an array of objects into testing and training data.
The model will begin training when you open the html file and you can watch the learning rate adjust in the js console. 
Once the model is trained you can use the predict() method in your js console to test your model against the testing data.
See code comments for how to adjust to other predictive modeling scenarios.
<h5>Open the cerealtensor.html file in your browser and open the javascript console to watch machine learning in real time! </h5>
